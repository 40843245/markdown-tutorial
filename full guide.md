## [Text](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#paragraphs-1)
### [Heading](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#paragraphs-1)
There are six different types of headings, from heading 1 to heading 6. 

Heading 1 has the biggest text among these headings. 

While heading 6 has the smallest text among these headings.

| Markdown	| HTML | Rendered Output |
| --------- | ---- | --------------- |
| # Heading level 1 | `<h1>Heading level 1</h1>` |	<h1>Heading level 1</h1> | 
| ## Heading level 2	| `<h2>Heading level 2</h2>` | <h2>Heading level 2</h2>	| 
| ### Heading level 3	| `<h3>Heading level 3</h3>` | <h3>Heading level 3</h3>	| 
| #### Heading level 4	| `<h4>Heading level 4</h4>` | <h4>Heading level 4</h4> |
| ##### Heading level 5	| `<h5>Heading level 5</h5>` | <h5>Heading level 5</h5> |
| ###### Heading level 6 | `<h6>Heading level 6</h6>`	| <h6>Heading level 6</h6> |

#### Alternative Syntax

| Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output |
| -------- | ---- | --------------- |
| Heading level 1 <br> ===============	| `<h1>Heading level 1</h1>` | <h1>Heading level 1</h1> |
| Heading level 2 <br> ---------------	| `<h2>Heading level 2</h2>` | <h2>Heading level 2</h2> |

#### **NOTES**
+ Don't forget to put one space between `#` and the first word.
+ `#` must be consecutive. For example, `## Heading 2` and `# # Heading 2` are **NOT** equivalent.

### [Paragraphs](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#paragraphs-1)
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

| Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output |
| -------- | ---- | --------------- |
| I really like using Markdown. <br> <br> I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.	| `<p>I really like using Markdown.</p> <p>I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.</p>` | <p>I really like using Markdown.</p> <p>I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.</p>
  
#### **NOTES**
Unless the paragraph is in a list, donâ€™t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

### [Line Breaks](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#line-breaks)
To create a line break or new line (in html `<br>`), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

| Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output |
| -------- | ---- | --------------- |
| This is the first line.  <br> And this is the second line. |	`<p>This is the first line.<br> And this is the second line.</p>`	 | <p>This is the first line.<br> And this is the second line.</p> |

#### **NOTES**
Unlike C, one can ***NOT*** `\` to break a new line.

See the example on [Line Break Best Practices](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#line-break-best-practices)

## [Blockquotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1)
### [Blockquotes with Single Line](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1)
To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.

    > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

### [Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#nested-blockquotes)

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

    > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
    >
    > The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
    
The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.


### [Nested Blockquotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#nested-blockquotes)
Blockquotes can be nested. Add a >> in front of the paragraph you want to nest.
    
    > Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
    >
    >> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

The rendered output looks like this:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

### Multiple Nested Blockquotes

Let's dig in with several examples.

+ Example 1: 3-level nested blcokquotes

    > I'm so excited. 
    > I didn't sleep well last night.
    >> We're going bird watching the camping.
    > It's a school assignment, 
    >>> so don't just play around. 
    > Please take it seriously.
    > We have to spend 3 weeks looking for birds.

The rendered output looks like this:

> I'm so excited. 
> I didn't sleep well last night.
>> We're going bird watching the camping.
> It's a school assignment, 
>>> so don't just play around. 
> Please take it seriously.
> We have to spend 3 weeks looking for birds.

+ Example 2: 12-level nested blockquotes

      > hey you young lady, can I have your seat?
      > why?
      >> why you say?
      > can you see this maternity badge here?
      >>> maternity badge?
      > it's a beige to prove that the holder of the beige is pregnant.
      >>>> yes as you can see I'm pregnant.
      > it's tiring to stand still for the baby.
      >>>>> give.
      > give up your seat.
      >>>>>> I know that pregnant women have a hard time
      > (O.S. but her tone can she be nicer )
      >>>>>>> but Midori is sitting
      > because she has a headache
      >>>>>>>>> hey dck she's still young a little pant
      > you would be a problem
      >>>>>>>>>> but it's a matter of life or death of my child
      > can you understand hold up now
      >>>>>>>>>>> you're too much are
      > Other poeple says: they arguing can't they do this elsewhere
      >>>>>>>>>>>> gosh thanks to this keys
      > I'm attracting so much attention

The rendered output looks like this:

> hey you young lady, can I have your seat?
> why?
>> why you say?
> can you see this maternity badge here?
>>> maternity badge?
> it's a beige to prove that the holder of the beige is pregnant.
>>>> yes as you can see I'm pregnant.
> it's tiring to stand still for the baby.
>>>>> give.
> give up your seat.
>>>>>> I know that pregnant women have a hard time
> (O.S. but her tone can she be nicer )
>>>>>>> but Midori is sitting
> because she has a headache
>>>>>>>>> hey dck she's still young a little pant
> you would be a problem
>>>>>>>>>> but it's a matter of life or death of my child
> can you understand hold up now
>>>>>>>>>>> you're too much are
> Other poeple says: they arguing can't they do this elsewhere
>>>>>>>>>>> gosh thanks to this keys
> I'm attracting so much attention

+ Example 3: 4-level blockquotes where there are no one `>` as seperator in each different level
  
      > I'm glad you finally understand.
      >> you're lucky. Midory is way too nice huh.
      >>> it's all for to say to an unwell person.
      >>>> it's not a big deal AE what she's got a point.

The rendered output looks like this:

> I'm glad you finally understand.
>> you're lucky. Midory is way too nice huh.
>>> it's all for to say to an unwell person.
>>>> it's not a big deal AE what she's got a point.

+ Example 4: 4-level nested blockquotes in reversed order.

      >>>> in the following week,
      >>> ouch ouch are you okay?
      >> stepping into the gap between the train and the platform...
      > why are you always so careless?

The rendered output looks like this:

>>>> in the following week,
>>> ouch ouch are you okay?
>> stepping into the gap between the train and the platform...
> why are you always so careless?


+ Example 5: concatenation of 4-level nested blockquotes in non-reversed order and that in reversed order.
  
      > I wasn't paying attention because the train was about to leave once we get over there
      >> we need to get it treat.
      >>> sorry to trouble you.
      >>>> we still have two more weeks left for bird watching,
      >>>> so you need to be more careful.
      >>> huh those are the kids from last week.
      >> they're here again.
      > how dare they embrace me last time?

The rendered output looks like this:

> I wasn't paying attention because the train was about to leave once we get over there
>> we need to get it treat.
>>> sorry to trouble you.
>>>> we still have two more weeks left for bird watching,
>>>> so you need to be more careful.
>>> huh those are the kids from last week
>> they're here again
> how dare they embrace me last time?

### [Blockquotes with Other Elements](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-with-other-elements)

Let's dig in with several examples.

+ Example 1:

    > #### The quarterly results look great!
    >
    > - Revenue was off the chart.
    > - Profits were higher than ever.
    >
    >  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

The rendered output looks like this:

> #### The quarterly results look great!
>
> - Revenue was off the chart.
> - Profits were higher than ever.
>
>  *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

+ Example 2:
  
      > # hey you guys stand up and give me your seat.
      > but ***Kary*** is injured.
      > I'm sorry. could you ask ___someone___ else for the seat?
      > just BR her ankle what 'prank'.
      > Other people says: do they know each other? `unbelievable`, how can she demand that seen from an ```injured girl```?
      > I'm fine.
      > come on.
      > <em>please sit down</em>. 
      > Kary, are you able to <strong>stand alone</strong>?
      > I'm okay.<br> I'm good at standing on one foot.<br><br>

The rendered output looks like this:

> # hey you guys stand up and give me your seat.
> but ***Kary*** is injured.
> I'm sorry. could you ask ___someone___ else for the seat?
> just BR her ankle what 'prank'.
> Other people says: do they know each other? `unbelievable`, how can she demand that seen from an ```injured girl```?
> I'm fine.
> come on.
> <em>please sit down</em>. 
> Kary, are you able to <strong>stand alone</strong>?
> I'm okay.<br> I'm good at standing on one foot.<br><br>

#### **NOTES**
For compatibility, put blank lines before and after blockquotes.

Don't do this

```
Without blank lines, this might not look right.
> This is a blockquote
Don't do this!
```

## [Lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1)
### [Ordered Lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#ordered-lists)
See [example in Ordered Lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#ordered-lists)

#### **NOTES**

```
CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you use a parenthesis ()) as a delimiter (e.g., 1) First item), 
but not all Markdown applications support this,
so it isnâ€™t a great option from a compatibility perspective. For compatibility, use periods only.
```

### [Unordered Lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#unordered-lists)
See [example in Unordered Lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#unordered-lists)

### [Starting Unordered List Items With Numbers](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#starting-unordered-list-items-with-numbers)

If you need to start an unordered list item with a number followed by a period, you can use a backslash (\) to escape the period.

See [example in Starting Unordered List Items With Numbers](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#starting-unordered-list-items-with-numbers)

#### **NOTES**

Markdown applications donâ€™t agree on how to handle different delimiters in the same list. 

For compatibility, donâ€™t mix and match delimiters in the same list â€” pick one and stick with it.

### [Adding Elements in Lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#adding-elements-in-lists)

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab, as shown in the following examples.

#### **Tip** 

If things don't appear the way you expect, re-check that you've indented the elements in the list four spaces or one tab.

See [example in Adding Elements in Lists](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#adding-elements-in-lists)

## [Code and Code Block](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code)
### [Code within Single line](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code)
To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

| Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output |
| -------- | ---- | --------------- |
| ```At the command prompt, type `nano` ```.|	`At the command prompt, type <code>nano</code> .`	| At the command prompt, type <code>nano</code> .

### **Extra Info**
For Escaping Backticks on Code, see [Escaping Backticks on Code](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#escaping-backticks).

### [Code Blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code-blocks)

To create code blocks, either 

+ indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab. Or
+ use "```".
