## Text
### Heading 
There are six different types of headings, from heading 1 to heading 6. 

Heading 1 has the biggest text among these headings. 

While heading 6 has the smallest text among these headings.

| Markdown	| HTML | Rendered Output |
| --------- | ---- | --------------- |
| # Heading level 1 | `<h1>Heading level 1</h1>` |	<h1>Heading level 1</h1> | 
| ## Heading level 2	| `<h2>Heading level 2</h2>` | <h2>Heading level 2</h2>	| 
| ### Heading level 3	| `<h3>Heading level 3</h3>` | <h3>Heading level 3</h3>	| 
| #### Heading level 4	| `<h4>Heading level 4</h4>` | <h4>Heading level 4</h4> |
| ##### Heading level 5	| `<h5>Heading level 5</h5>` | <h5>Heading level 5</h5> |
| ###### Heading level 6 | `<h6>Heading level 6</h6>`	| <h6>Heading level 6</h6> |

#### Alternative Syntax

| Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output |
| -------- | ---- | --------------- |
| Heading level 1 <br> ===============	| `<h1>Heading level 1</h1>` | <h1>Heading level 1</h1> |
| Heading level 2 <br> ---------------	| `<h2>Heading level 2</h2>` | <h2>Heading level 2</h2> |

#### **NOTES**
+ Don't forget to put one space between `#` and the first word.
+ `#` must be consecutive. For example, `## Heading 2` and `# # Heading 2` are **NOT** equivalent.

### Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

| Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output |
| -------- | ---- | --------------- |
| I really like using Markdown. <br> <br> I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.	| `<p>I really like using Markdown.</p> <p>I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.</p>` | <p>I really like using Markdown.</p> <p>I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.</p>
  
#### **NOTES**
Unless the paragraph is in a list, donâ€™t indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

### Line Breaks
To create a line break or new line (in html `<br>`), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.

| Markdown | HTML | Rendered Output |
| -------- | ---- | --------------- |
| This is the first line.  <br> And this is the second line. |	`<p>This is the first line.<br> And this is the second line.</p>`	 | <p>This is the first line.<br> And this is the second line.</p> |

#### **NOTES**
Unlike C, one can ***NOT*** `\` to break a new line.

See the example on [Line Break Best Practices](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#line-break-best-practices)
